MESSAGE FROM THE RECTOR

 

Vietnam officially joined the WTO in 2006, which urges the country to have highly qualified human resources for a developing knowledge society, especially in highly value-added fields. In acknowledging the shortcomings of a traditional university system for today’s needs; from the encouragement of the government in educational socialization for greater human resource development; and from the demand of FPT Corporation - the biggest IT and Telecommunications Corporation in Vietnam, FPT University was officially established.

 

FPT University is the first university in Vietnam established by an enterprise, led by a modern philosophy. The curricula with practical-oriented design have helped narrow the gap between education and industry demand. FPT students are provided the best conditions for professional development including languages and soft skills to meet the requirements to be qualified experts in a global working environment.

 

FPT University is now starting to reap the fruits of its labor after five years: 100% graduates have jobs or are pursuing master degrees. Currently we are training 15,000 students in different programs. We steadily grow at 40% per year.

 

In 2012, FPT University became the first university in Vietnam to be awarded a 3-star ranking by the QS World University Ranking System - one among three of the most well-known university ranking systems in the world. That year also experienced the official implementation of the GO GLOBAL strategy. Accordingly, the university strongly promotes international cooperation, international admission and recruitment as well as opening campuses overseas. One of our targets is to continuously improve our quality and become a world-class university in Vietnam.
